# Implementation Plan for HiveMind

This document outlines the implementation plan for the HiveMind MVP, organized into sprints.

---

## Overview

HiveMind is an extension of OpenAI's Swarm library that introduces a centralized `HiveMindAgent` to orchestrate interactions between multiple specialized `SwarmAgents`. The goal is to create a flexible and scalable framework for complex AI agent interactions using machine-readable workflow specifications.

- **Utilize examples to test user interaction flows.**

**Tasks:**

1. **User Input Requests:**

   - Develop a protocol for `SwarmAgents` to indicate the need for additional input.
   - Implement methods in `HiveMindAgent` to prompt the user and collect input.

2. **Workflow Update Mechanism:**

   - Allow the workflow execution to pause and resume based on user input.
   - Ensure the new input is incorporated into the ongoing tasks.

3. **User Interface:**

   - Design a simple command-line or web-based interface for user interactions.
   - Ensure prompts and inputs are clear and user-friendly.

4. **Example Integration:**

   - **Use the sample workflows and agents to test user interaction scenarios.**
   - **Document any issues and refine the interaction mechanisms accordingly.**
